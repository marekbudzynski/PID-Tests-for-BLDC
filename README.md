# PID-Tests-for-BLDC
Some Arduino PID tests for BLDC. Most of these have been acced via Youtube to try to make a BLDC with Hall output with a controller run in a closed loop.
None of this has been made by me it's just a good place to put stuff. The main aim is to create code that will do the job. Once it's done it'll be accessed for free with no guarantees or liability.
